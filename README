An early version of the html+javascript that will power the App Inventor map
component.

I am trying to avoid all extra work for our users having to sign the app (needed
when using the Android SDK) and instead using the JavaScript API (it only needs
an API Key).

Initially, the code was purposely built in one file, as it will be loaded into
an Android WebView. This View has an interface for two way communication between
Java and JavaScript, so the JavaScript in this file can be augmented with values
from Java, and the Java side can also interact with the JavaScript.

At some point in 2016, I decided to use Grunt to build the unique file from a
series of modules using ES6 and babelify. And that's where I am at. Following
are the list of tasks to be completed in the near future:

TODOs:
  - integrate http://eslint.org/
  - start pulling out code from the main mapComponent.html file into modules.
  - come up with a way of generating a final html file with all the code inside.
